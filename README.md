# blue_vs_blue_SSH


# Goals
After they sign up, it will display the private key that was created for them. ( dont saved to disked ).
  - They will have to save the private key. If they exit the tab they will [b]NOT[/b] be able to recover the key.
  - To access the blue vs blue environment they will need the key. This is done for a couple of reasons:
            - Get people fimilar with ssh keys in a non class environment.
            - For security. So other people that are not involved with the competition cant access the environment.
            - Im doing this for the challenge. I already created a blue vs blue environment but I waanted to make improve it.
